# @mxstbr's Karabiner Elements configuration

If you like TypeScript and want your Karabiner configuration maintainable & type-safe, you probably want to use the custom configuration DSL / generator I created in `rules.ts` and `utils.ts`!

> “This repo is incredible - thanks so much for putting it together! I always avoided Karabiner mostly because of its complicated configuration. **Your project makes it so much easier to work with and so much more powerful. I'm geeking out on how much faster I'm going to be now.**”

You probably don't want to use my exact configuration, as it's optimized for my personal style & usage. Best way to go about using this if you want to? Probably delete all the sublayers in `rules.ts` and add your own based on your own needs!
